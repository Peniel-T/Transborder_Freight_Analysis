# TransBorder Freight Analysis (CRISP-DM Project)

###  Project Overview

This project explores patterns and trends in cross-border **U.S. TransBorder Freight** data provided by the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)**. The goal is to uncover key insights about trade patterns between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico using the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.

### Key Steps and Processes
1. Data Exraction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Wrangling
4.  Data Modeling
5. Data Visualization
6. Bussiness Recommendation


## Business Objective to understand and visualize:

* The top traded commodities across borders
* Differences in export and import values
* Most active U.S. states, Canadian provinces, and Mexican states
* Freight costs by mode of transport and trade type
* Trends in domestic vs. foreign sourced goods
* Seasonal trend in freight weight and value
* Correlation between shipping weight and freight charges

### Tools & Technologies

* Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, geopandas)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Git & GitHub
* CRISP-DM methodology
* Excel (preprocessing)



### Key Visualizations

* Top 10 Commodities by Trade Value (Bar Chart)
* Import vs Export by Mode (Bar Chart)
* U.S. States with Highest Trade Volumes (Choropleth Map)
* Canada/Mexico Regions with Most Activity (Horizontal Bar Chart)

### Sample Business Questions

1. Which U.S. states handle the most cross-border freight?
2. What are the top traded commodities across NAFTA borders?
3. How do freight charges vary by transport mode?
4. Are there seasonal patterns in trade volume?
5. What is the balance of imports vs. exports per country?
